            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My journey with code began in early 2020 after being laid off from my 14 year career as a hydraulic technician. I have always been interested in video games so
                I decided to dabble with the Unity game engine. This lead me into learning some C# via Unity tutorials and YouTube tutorials. This was interesting and enjoyable but I needed to 
            find a path that would hopefully allow me to support my family in a much shorter time frame. After some investigation, Front-end dev seemed to be a good idea. At first I tried teaching
            myself strictly with YouTube but quickly realised that I needed to do more so I subscribed to the Codecademy site and enrolled in the Front-End Engineer career path. It has been difficult
        but rewarding. I am truly amazed at what I have learned so far. I also know that I have so much more to learn and that the learning will never stop.</p><br>
